- `mfa_env/` directory (547 MB virtual environment)
  - Not needed in repository (users create their own)
  - Already covered in .gitignore

**Why removed:**
- Virtual environments should not be committed to git
- .DS_Store files are macOS-specific and unnecessary
- Keeps repository clean and professional
- Reduces repository size significantly
